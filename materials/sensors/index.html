  <h1>Sensors</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Water Level Sensor:</h3>
  <p>Measures the level of water that it's submerged in, and if it's above a certain amount, it sets of the alarm.</p>
  <p>Could be used to sense the beginning of floods or water leaks.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>IR Motion Sensor:</h3>
  <p>Senses motion in front of it and sets of the alarm.</p>
  <p>Could be used for a motion controlled light or alarm system.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor:</h3>
  <p>Measures the humidity and temperature of the air around it.</p>
  <p>Could be used as part of a thermostat or hygrometer.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>MQ-2 Gas Sensor:</h3>
  <p>Senses the approximate concentration of H2, LPG, CH4, CO, Alcohol, Smoke or Propane.</p>
  <p>Could be used as a gas leakage sensor or as part of a smoke detector.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Flame Sensor:</h3>
  <p>Senses the proximity of a flame.</p>
  <p>Could be used as part of a fire sensor.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Photoresistor:</h3>
  <p>Senses how much light there is and if the light level is low enough it turns on 2 white LED's.</p>
  <p>Could be used for automatic outdoor lights which turn on at night.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Colour Sensor:</h3>
  <p>Senses the approximate RGB values of an object in front of it.</p>
  <p>No real use in an actual house</p>
